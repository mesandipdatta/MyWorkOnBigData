Validation Process
All files in the output directory are assumed to be compared for validation unless explicitly stated.  Any other necessary validation must be provided, reports and or Spufi results and how EMC can recreated the data in SQL Server.
Files used as input for both online and batch steps need to be provided for each script.
Files created\modified for both online and batch steps need to be provided.
Intermediate files are necessary to expedite debugging.
NOTE: See Bundle 2 spreadsheets for the complete list of DB2 and IDMS input data used.
***   Special Note on use of job-audit utility programs (SE0001B or XM00H01B)    ***
These are common programs that are used in most jobs with system identifiers: BH, CC, CU, SE, and XM. 
 Their purpose is to insert a row in the CS. COD_COLUMN_DECODE DB2 table, once at the beginning of the batch job, and once at the end.  These are used for job/system audits.  Once this has been validated to work correctly once, it does not need to be validated in each and every job.
Successful execution can be validated by verifying at end-of-job, that two rows were inserted with valid run-time timestamps:
SELECT SUBSTR(DATABASE_ALIAS,1,2)   AS SYS
 , SUBSTR(';',1,1)
 , TABLE_NAME_PREFIX            AS FREQ
 , SUBSTR(';',1,1)
 , SUBSTR(COLUMN_NAME,1,19)     AS JOB_TIME
 , SUBSTR(';',1,1)
 , SUBSTR(ENCODED_CODE,1,8)     AS JOB_NAME
 , SUBSTR(';',1,1)
 , DECODED_ABRV_DESC            AS STA

 , SUBSTR(';',1,1)
 FROM CS.COD_COLUMN_DECODE
 WHERE ENCODED_CODE           = 'job-name'   replace with actual prod job-name
 ;
Sample results of above query, where job-name = ‘PDCC2590’.  Timestamps will match your test run times.
